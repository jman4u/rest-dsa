# rest-dsa

In this project I created a REST API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The goal of the API was to describe the main data structures used
throughout computer science and provide real world applications for them.
The API provides full functionality of all CRUD API endpoints (get, post, patch, delete). Finally, I dockerized the
project and used Heroku to deploy both the web and mongo docker images while maintaining a config variable to store the credentials needed to authenticate access to the MongoDB database.


A simple get request using postman on the app link yields the following results:
